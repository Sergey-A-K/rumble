# This is a list of manual whitelist entries that have been discovered
# so far for various reasons.

# This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all servers that should be 
# considered legitimate, merely a list of servers that for one reason or 
# another may either have some type of problem with the Greylisting method, 
# or because of a recognized need to avoid the delay that it may cause.

# These are common entries that most people using greylisting will probably 
# want to have.  If you happen to discover ones that aren't in this list, 
# or that the IP's in this list have changed, please let me know at 
# eharris@puremagic.com, after reading the next paragraph carefully.

# PLEASE NOTE - PLEASE NOTE - PLEASE NOTE - PLEASE NOTE - PLEASE NOTE
# Any submission for inclusion to this list should be accompanied by
# the IP's or address range of the mailservers that have a problem sending 
# to Greylisting servers, the name/url of the organization running these 
# problem servers, and a detail of the specific reason(s) why their systems
# have a problem with Greylisting, and also the type of mail server softare
# they are running (if known).

# Valid reasons for inclusion on this list are:
#   1. They have a pool of round-robin outbound mail servers that spans more 
#      than one /24 netblock.
#   2. They have software that considers a 4xx temporary mail failure to be
#      a permanent bounce.
#   3. Their mail servers retry delivery for 4xx failures continually with
#      no delay.
#   4. Their mail servers either don't retry at all, or have a very long 
#      retry delay (more than 5 hours).
#   5. The mail servers use a unique sender address for each delivery
#      attempt, even for the same piece of mail.  (also known as VERP).
#   6. The mail servers host high volume mailing lists with a general appeal
#      that try to track bounces by using a unique sender address for each
#      mail (also known as VERP).

# Generally, submissions of servers that do not meet at least one of the 
# above criteria will not be accepted for inclusion in this list.  This 
# includes servers that handle Greylisting ok, but that you consider 
# "legitimate", and don't want their mail delayed.  Since "legitimate" is a
# subjective distinction, I believe that those types of whitelist entries 
# are better left for individual administrators to decide.

# ****** IF YOU ARE USING A DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION THAN RELAYDELAY ******
# Before submitting a potential entry, please check that your implementation
# uses the 451 error code (not 450 or another 4xx code).  Some problems have
# been reported for sites like MSN/Hotmail, Prodigy, and various other 
# senders that appear to be having "weird" retry patterns (sometimes 
# resulting in bounces) when using code 450 or others.

# Because error code 450 is most commonly used for a mailbox lock failure,
# many sites seem to treat it as a very short duration failure, and will
# retry several times within seconds, and then bounce the mail, while they
# handle a code 451 more "normally".

# Here's an example command to use in a mysql shell to insert 
#   a whitelist entry (assumes defaults from dbdef.sql):
# INSERT INTO relaytofrom (relay_ip, record_expires, create_time) 
#   VALUES ('127.0.0.1', '9999-12-31 23:59:59', NOW());

127.0.0.1       # Of course we don't want to delay ourselves or local users
192.168         # Don't delay our private networks either
10              # Private net (class A)
172.16          # Another private net (inidividual entries, since can't
172.17          #   do a /12 netmask easily
